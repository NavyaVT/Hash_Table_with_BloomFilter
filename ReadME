This is an implementation of Hash Tables with bloom filter. 
This has insert, display, search, delete and search with bloom filter. 
Bloom filter is a search algorithm that predicts if a element is present or not. 
It never gives false negatives but rather gives false positives and we can further request on deep searches to find if element is actually present.
It is used in search engines, recommendation systems, and for faster lookups
